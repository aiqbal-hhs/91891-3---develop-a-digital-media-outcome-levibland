NOTES:
If deploying to a hosting service different to github pages, it is preferred that the css build files (build.css, all css files aggrgated into one otherwise gh pages has a fit) are deleted and the the old main.css files are imported into the html files instead. build.css files are only a necessity and should not be used in production unless absolutely necessary.
